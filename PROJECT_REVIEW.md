## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design (9/10)

### ‚úÖ Strengths:
- **Clean MVC Architecture**: Well-separated concerns with distinct Controller, Model, DAO, Service layers
- **Proper Package Organization**: Logical grouping by functionality
  ```
  com.eventApp/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Controller/     # UI logic
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Model/          # Data models
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DAO/            # Database access
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Service/        # Business logic
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Utils/          # Utilities
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DataStructures/ # Custom implementations
  ```
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic properly abstracted
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean database abstraction via DAOs
- **Custom Data Structures**: Domain-specific CircularLL and MyEventLL

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement:

### Key Statistics:
- **Total Lines**: ~6,650 lines of Java code
- **Classes**: 50+ classes across 8 packages
- **FXML Files**: 23 UI layouts
- **Documentation Coverage**: >90%

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design (9/10)

### ‚úÖ Strengths:
- **Comprehensive Schema**: 8 main tables with proper relationships
  - `users` ‚Üí `students`, `club_members`
  - `clubs` ‚Üí `events` ‚Üí `event_registrations`
  - `notifications`, `event_history` for tracking
- **Referential Integrity**: Proper foreign keys and cascade rules
- **Advanced Features**:
  - 5+ stored procedures for business logic
  - Triggers for automatic count updates
  - Functions for validation and rule enforcement
- **Data Consistency**: Check constraints ensure valid statuses
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive event history tracking

### Database Highlights:
```sql
-- Dynamic pricing stored procedure
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE apply_ticket_price_rules()

-- Event completion automation
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE event_complete()

-- Capacity validation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION checkcount(event_id INT)
```
